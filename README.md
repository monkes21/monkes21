- You can check a monke's availability by using the check button below it's image. NOTE: This doesn't include any unconfirmed inscriptions, you can check unconfirmed inscriptions on Unisat.
- The status of the monke will appear on the bottom right of the page, if it's free; right click save as .PNG and inscribe using your favorite service.
- Confirmed taken monkes will appear grayed out, updates on confirmed taken monkes will happen periodically.
- Always use the check button as some monkes will be inscribed but not be confirmed taken.  Find the confirmed taken monkes
